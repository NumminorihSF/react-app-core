[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Saritasa/react-app-core.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Package that implements base application's functional to prevent copy-pasting it between different projects.

**Not stable currently**

Installation:
```bash
npm i --save react-app-core
```

For correct bundling an app, you should pass `process.env.TARGET === 'client'` into webpack's DefinePlugin.


Main part of documentation is in process of work. Sorry.
